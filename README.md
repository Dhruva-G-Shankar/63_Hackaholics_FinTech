develop a Budget Tracker application that allows users to manage their finances and provides insights into their spending habits and savings progress. The application will track monthly income, expenses, and savings goals. The system should provide real-time financial summaries, advice, and visualizations to help the user make informed financial decisions.

Functional Requirements:
Income Management:

The user should be able to input their monthly income.
The user should be able to add additional income (e.g., bonuses or side earnings) during the month, which will update the balance and the monthly income accordingly.
Expense Tracking:

The user should be able to add expenses, specifying a category, subcategory, and the amount spent.
Each expense should reduce the balance and contribute to the total expenses for the month.
The tracker should maintain a record of all expenses, and it should be possible to display them as a list or table.
Savings Goal:

The user should be able to set a savings goal for the month (e.g., saving a specific amount for a future goal).
The user should be able to add savings contributions, which will reduce the available balance.
Budget Status and Financial Advice:

The tracker should provide a summary of the budget, including total income, total expenses, remaining balance, and savings status.
Based on the current financial situation, the system should offer personalized advice:
Whether the user is spending wisely or overspending.
Whether the user is on track to meet their savings goal or needs to save more.
Expense and Savings Visualizations:

The tracker should include various charts and graphs to visually represent the financial data:
Expense distribution by category (using a pie chart).
Savings progress compared to the goal (using a donut chart).
Income vs Expenses comparison (using a bar chart).
Expense trends over time (using a line chart).
Data Display:

The user should be able to view a summary of their financial data, including:
Monthly income.
Total expenses.
Balance after expenses and savings.
Expense percentage relative to income.
Savings percentage relative to the goal.
Financial advice based on current spending and savings habits.
